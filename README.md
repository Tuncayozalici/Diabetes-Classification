## About the Project 🏥
In this project, we utilize various machine learning algorithms to classify diabetes. The goal is to develop a model that can predict whether a person has diabetes based on the features in the dataset.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- Python 🐍
- Scikit-learn 🧠
- Pandas 🐼
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib 📈

## Installation 💻
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/diabetes-classification.git
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage 🚀
To run the project and train the model, follow these steps:

1. Load and preprocess the data:
    ```python
    python data_preprocessing.py
    ```

2. Train the model:
    ```python
    python train_model.py
    ```

3. Evaluate the model:
    ```python
    python evaluate_model.py
    ```
